# Bayesiamplify
Redoing GANplification with Bayesian-CFM Generative Model.

Todos:

    - Connect & Run AdamMCMC
    - Connect to quantiling
    - Plot behavior for higher numbers sampled (Expectation: Converges to level of statistics of training data )
    - Calibration test possible?
    - Plot behavior for differing numbers of quantiles (Expectation: Amplification independent)
    - Plot behavior for higher numbers of training data, scaling the number of of quantiles (Expectation: Maybe the Amplification decreases, whos knows)
    - Plot behavior for higher dimensions (Expectation: Maybe the Amplification decreases, whos knows)

    - maybe add Bayesian-Calomplification
